# Harsh-Sound-Detection-Machine-Learning-Model
This project explores the classification of spectrogram images generated from music clips into two categories: clean and harsh. The primary objective was to build a convolutional neural network capable of identifying harshness in audio signals from spectrograms to apply image-based machine learning techniques to the audio domain.
